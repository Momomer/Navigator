Momer:
The heap appears to be nearly finished. Good job. Now we have to test it. 
Create performance and correctness tests. In the former, the number of elements "n" should
be at least ten million. 

Because the heap function is called at least once every 2 seconds, the following should hold true:

#The combined operation of creating a heap with 10000 elements and extracting them all sequentially should not take more than 0.1 seconds on PC2
and ideally not more than 0.3 seconds on PC1.
