This is the stuff that would be great to have finished by July 17:

Min Heap (including performance and unit tests)

If time is available, Dijkstra's Algorithm (excluding performance and unit tests)
should also be completed.

General outlook for the next 7 days (until July 18):

Finish Min Heap
Finish Dijkstra's Algorithm
Finish Graph Class (both, adjacency list and linked list representation)
Mental model for the general framework of the Navigation system

Will be tough but doable!
