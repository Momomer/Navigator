This is the stuff that would be great to have finished by July 17:

Min Heap (including performance and unit tests) [DONE]

If time is available, Dijkstra's Algorithm (excluding performance and unit tests)
should also be completed.

General outlook for the next 7 days (until July 18):

Finish Min Heap  [DONE]
Finish Dijkstra's Algorithm [DONE]
Finish Graph Class (both, adjacency list and linked list representation) [DONE]
Mental model for the general framework of the Navigation system [DONE]

All done!
